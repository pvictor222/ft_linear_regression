# ft_linear_regression

Project from 42 School

*How it works*
1) "python3 model_training.py"
==> Calculates theta_0 and theta_1 using gradient descent and stores it in theta.txt
2) "python3 price_estimate.py"
==> Asks the user for an a milage and returns an estimate of the price, based on theta_0 and theta_1 (both set to 0 before running model_training.py). The price can't be negative.

*Bonuses*
- Plotting the data into a graph to see their repartition
- Plotting the linear regression into the graph
- Calculating the cost of the model
- Asking the user what should be the maximum number of iterations
- Calculating the actual number of iterations
